Results from the largest-ever observational study offers reassurance to women who choose a more conservative approach removal of just the tumor and some tissue around it (lumpectomy) followed by radiation therapy. In fact, the study showed that, as a group, women who chose lumpectomy plus radiation had lower death rates from breast cancer and all causes than women who chose mastectomy. The women who appeared to reap the biggest survival benefit from lumpectomy plus radiation therapy were those over age 50 with estrogen-positive breast cancer, with 13% lower mortality from breast cancer and 19% lower for all causes. The results were reported online today in the journal Cancer. For early-stage breast cancer, mastectomy has been proven to cure or at least retard the disease.

The several kinds of anemia are produced by a variety of underlying causes.

The three main classes include excessive blood loss (acutely such as a hemorrhage or chronically through low-volume loss), excessive blood cell destruction (hemolysis) or deficient red blood cell production (ineffective hematopoiesis).','At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the word \"anemia\" was a clinical term referring to pallor of the skin and mucous membranes.

Skeletal evidence of the disease (ossification of joints and entheses primarily of the axial skeleton, known as \"bamboo spine\") was found in an archaeological dig that unearthed the skeletal remains of a 5000-yearï¿½??old Egyptian mummy with evidence of bamboo spine.The anatomist and surgeon Realdo Colombo described what could have been the disease in 1559, and the first account of pathologic changes to the skeleton possibly associated with AS was published in 1691 by Bernard Connor. In 1818, Benjamin Brodie became the first physician to document a patient believed to have active AS who also had accompanying iritis. In 1858, David Tucker published a small booklet which clearly described a patient, Leonard Trask, who suffered from severe spinal deformity subsequent to AS. In 1833, Trask fell from a horse, exacerbating the condition and resulting in severe deformity. Tucker reported:\r\nï¿½?? It was not until he [Trask] had exercised for some time that he could perform any labor.... [H]is neck and back have continued to curve drawing his head downward on his breast. 	ï¿½??\r\n','disease image/56.jpg'),
 (57,'Asthma','Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction,and bronchospasm. Asthma is a disorder that causes the airways of the lungs to swell and narrow, leading to wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. Asthma makes breathing difficult. Bronchial tubes that are chronically inflamed may become overly sensitive to allergens (specific triggers) or irritants (nonspecific triggers). The airways may become \"twitchy\" and remain in a state of heightened sensitivity. This is called \"bronchial hyperreactivity\" (BHR). It is likely that there is a spectrum of bronchial hyperreactivity in all individuals. However, it is clear that asthmatics and allergic individuals (without apparent asthma) have a greater degree of bronchial hyperreactivity than nonasthmatic and nonallergic people. In sensitive individuals, the bronchial tubes are more likely to swell and constrict when exposed to triggers such as allergens, tobacco smoke, or exercise. ','Asthma was recognized in Ancient Egypt and was treated by drinking an incense mixture known as kyphi. It was officially named as a specific respiratory problem by Hippocrates circa 450 BC, with the Greek word for \"panting\" forming the basis of our modern name. In 200 BC it was believed to be at least partly related to the emotions. In 1873, one of the first papers in modern medicine on the subject tried to explain the pathophysiology of the disease while one in 1872, concluded that asthma can be cured by rubbing the chest with chloroform liniment. Medical treatment in 1880, included the use of intravenous doses of a drug called pilocarpin. During the 1930sâ??50s, asthma was known as one of the \"holy seven\" psychosomatic illnesses. Its cause was considered to be psychological, with treatment often based on psychoanalysis and other talking cures. As these psychoanalysts interpreted the asthmatic wheeze as the suppressed cry of the child for its mother, they considered the treatment of depression to be especially important for individuals with asthma.

 (58,'Autism','Autism is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old.  Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. It is one of three recognized disorders in the autism spectrum (ASDs), the other two being Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.','null','disease image/58.jpg'),
 (59,'Brain tumor ','A brain tumor, or tumour, is an intracranial solid neoplasm, a tumor (defined as an abnormal growth of cells) within the brain or the central spinal canal. Brain tumors include all tumors inside the cranium or in the central spinal canal. They are created by an abnormal and uncontrolled cell division, usually in the brain itself, but also in lymphatic tissue, in blood vessels, in the cranial nerves, in the brain envelopes (meninges), skull, pituitary gland, or pineal gland. Within the brain itself, the involved cells may be neurons or glial cells (which include astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells). Brain tumors may also spread from cancers primarily located in other organs (metastatic tumors).\r\nAny brain tumor is inherently serious and life-threatening because of its invasive and infiltrative character in the limited space of the intracranial cavity. However, brain tumors (even malignant ones) are not invariably fatal, especially lipomas which are inherently benign. Brain tumors or intracranial neoplasms can be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign); however, the definitions of malignant or benign neoplasms differs from those commonly used in other types of cancerous or non-cancerous neoplasms in the body. Its threat level depends on the combination of factors like the type of tumor, its location, its size and its state of development. Because the brain is well protected by the skull, the early detection of a brain tumor occurs only when diagnostic tools are directed at the intracranial cavity. \r\n',' Over the years, more has been discovered through research about the causes of brain cancer. In 1987, a study put out by the New York State Health Department showed that children who lived near power lines were more likely to develop brain cancer or leukemia due to the exposure to high magnetic fields','disease image/59.jpg'),
 (60,'Breast Cancer','Breast cancer is a type of cancer originating from breast tissue, most commonly from the inner lining of milk ducts or the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers originating from ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those originating from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. Breast cancer occurs in humans and other mammals. While the overwhelming majority of human cases occur in women, male breast cancer can also occur','Breast cancer has been known to mankind since ancient times. It has been mentioned in almost every period of recorded history. Because of the visible symptoms especially at later stages the lumps that progress to tumors have been recorded by physicians from early times. Ancient Egyptians were the first to note the disease more than 3,500 years ago. In 460 B.C., Hippocrates, the father of Western Medicine, described breast cancer as a humoral disease.

It usually starts with vesicular skin rash mainly on the body and head rather than at the periphery and becomes itchy, raw pockmarks, which mostly heal without scarring. On examination, the observer typically finds lesions at various stages of healing.','Chickenpox is believed to have been first described (discovered) by Giovanni Filippo during the 1500s in Italy. In the 1600s, an English physician named Richard Morton gave the name chickenpox to what he thought was a milder form of smallpox. It is believed that in the 1700s, William Heberden (another English physician), was the first physician to prove that chickenpox was actually different from smallpox.','disease image/61.jpg'),
 (62,'Cholera','Cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It has a short incubation period, from less than one day to five days, and produces an enterotoxin that causes a copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given. Vomiting also occurs in most patients.','The word cholera is from Greek meaning \"bile\". Cholera likely has its origins in the Indian Subcontinent; it has been prevalent in the Ganges delta since ancient times. The disease first spread by trade routes (land and sea) to Russia in 1817, then to the rest of Europe, and from Europe to North America. Seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the past 200 years, with the seventh originating in Indonesia in 1961.The first cholera pandemic occurred in the Bengal region of India starting in 1817 through 1824. The disease dispersed from India to Southeast Asia, China, Japan, the Middle East, and southern Russia.','disease image/62.jpg'),
 (63,'Dengue','Dengue fever is a disease caused by a family of viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes. It is an acute illness of sudden onset that usually follows a benign course with symptoms such as headache, fever, exhaustion, severe muscle and joint pain, swollen glands (lymphadenopathy) , and rash. The presence (the \"dengue triad\") of fever, rash, and headache (and other pains) is particularly characteristic of dengue. Other signs of dengue fever include bleeding gums, severe pain behind the eyes, and red palms and soles.\r\nDengue (pronounced DENG-gay) can affect anyone but tends to be more severe in people with compromised immune systems. Because it is caused by one of four serotypes of virus, it is possible to get dengue fever multiple times. However, an attack of dengue produces immunity for a lifetime to that particular serotype to which the patient was exposed\r\n','The first record of a case of probable dengue fever is in a Chinese medical encyclopedia from the Jin Dynasty (265â??420 AD) which referred to a \"water poison\" associated with flying insects. The primary vector, A. aegypti, spread out of Africa in the 15th to 19th centuries due in part to increased globalization secondary to the slave trade There have been descriptions of epidemics in the 17th century, but the most plausible early reports of dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780, when an epidemic swept Asia, Africa and North America From that time until 1940, epidemics were infrequent\r\nIn 1906, transmission by the Aedes mosquitoes was confirmed, and in 1907 dengue was the second disease (after yellow fever) that was shown to be caused by a virus.[46] Further investigations by John Burton Cleland and Joseph Franklin Siler completed the basic understanding of dengue transmission.\r\n',NULL);

It is a common cause of death in developing countries and the second most common cause of infant deaths worldwide. The loss of fluids through diarrhea can cause dehydration and electrolyte disturbances such as potassium deficiency or other salt imbalances.','Throughout history, infectious diarrhea has been associated with crowding, poor sanitation, and war. Although descriptions of infectious diarrhea exist in the earliest records of civilization, effective measures for prevention were not widely or consistently used until the modern era of active public health promotion. Advances in the understanding of etiologies and therapies have revolutionized prognosis; however, constant vigilance against lapses in public health is necessary to prevent outbreaks of disease.','disease image/64.jpg'),
 (65,'Diphtheria','Diphtheria is a contagious disease spread by direct physical contact or breathing the aerosolized secretions of infected individuals. Historically quite common, diphtheria has largely been eradicated in industrialized nations through widespread vaccination. In the United States, for example, there were 53 reported cases of diphtheria between 1980 and 2000,[6] but only a total of 2 cases of diphtheria have been reported in the 21st century, the last of which was in 2003.[7] The diphtheriaï¿½??pertussisï¿½??tetanus (DPT) vaccine is recommended for all school-age children in the U.S., and boosters of the vaccine are recommended for adults, since the benefits of the vaccine decrease with age without constant re-exposure; they are particularly recommended for those traveling to areas where the disease has not been eradicated.','A poster from the United Kingdom advertising diphtheria immunisation (published prior to 1962). In 1919, at Dallas, Texas, U.S.A., 10 children were killed and 60 others made seriously ill by toxin-antitoxin which had passed the tests of the New York State Health Department. Mulford Company of Philadelphia (manufacturers) paid damages in every case. In 1948, 68 of 606 children died after diphtheria immunization due to improper manufacture of aluminum phosphate toxoid. In 1974, WHO included DPT vaccine Expanded Programme on Immunization for developing countries. In 1975, Seattle reported an outbreak of cutaneous diphtheria. In 1994, Russian Federation saw 39,703 diphtheria cases. In contrast, in 1990, there had been only 1,211 cases. In early May 2010, a case of diphtheria was diagnosed in Port-au-Prince, Haiti after the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake.

It is believed that dyslexia can affect between 5 and 10 percent of a given population although there have been no studies to indicate an accurate percentageAdult dyslexics can read with good comprehension, but they tend to read more slowly than non-dyslexics and perform more poorly at spelling and nonsense word reading, a measure of phonological awareness. Dyslexia and IQ are not interrelated as a result of cognition developing independently. ','Dyslexia was identified by Oswald Berkhan in 1881, but the term dyslexia was coined in 1887 by Rudolf Berlin, who was an ophthalmologist in Stuttgart. He used the term to refer to a case of a young boy who had a severe impairment in learning to read and write in spite of showing typical intellectual and physical abilities in all other respects. In 1896 W. Pringle Morgan, a British physician from Seaford, East Sussex, published a description of a reading-specific learning disorder in a report to the British Medical Journal titled \"Congenital Word Blindness\". This described the case of a 14-year-old boy who had not yet learned to read, yet showed normal intelligence and was generally adept at other activities typical of children that age.','disease image/66.jpg'),

Bacteria are all around us, so mild cases of food poisoning are common. You may have had mild food poisoning ï¿½?? with diarrhea and an upset stomach ï¿½?? but your mom or dad just called it a stomach bug or stomach virus.','Illness-causing pathogens and microbes have been affecting humans since the beginning of our history. Outbreaks of food poisoning can be traced as far back as the Stone Age. The only difference between now and then is that, now, the causes of illness are identifiable and knowledge of how to protect against and prevent illness has been acquired.  Yet, despite years of history, ever-growing scientific knowledge, and continually improving sanitation and control techniques in the food industry, identifying and controlling outbreaks is still a tremendously challenging task.

If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung in a process called metastasis into nearby tissue and, eventually, into other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas that derive from epithelial cells. The main types of lung cancer are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), also called oat cell cancer, and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).','Lung cancer was uncommon before the advent of cigarette smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761. Different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810. Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10â??15% by the early 1900s.

 (69,'Goitre','A goitre or goiter (Latin gutteria, struma), is a swelling of the thyroid gland, which can lead to a swelling of the neck or larynx (voice box). Goitre is a term that refers to an enlargement of the thyroid (thyromegaly) and can be associated with a thyroid gland that is functioning properly or not. Worldwide, over 90.54% cases of goitre are caused by iodine deficiency.','Chinese physicians of the Tang Dynasty (618â??907) were the first to successfully treat patients with goitre by using the iodine-rich thyroid gland of animals such as sheep and pigsâ??in raw, pill, or powdered form.

 (70,'Jaundice','Jaundice (also known as icterus; from the Greek is a yellowish pigmentation of the skin, the conjunctival membranes over the sclerae (whites of the eyes), and other mucous membranes caused by hyperbilirubinemia (increased levels of bilirubin in the blood). This hyperbilirubinemia subsequently causes increased levels of bilirubin in the extracellular fluid. Concentration of bilirubin in blood plasma is normally below 1.2 mg/dL (<25Âµmol/L). A concentration higher than 2.5 mg/dL (>50Âµmol/L) leads to jaundice. The term jaundice comes from the French word jaune, meaning yellow. Jaundice is often seen in liver disease such as hepatitis or liver cancer. It may also indicate leptospirosis or obstruction of the biliary tract, for example by gallstones or pancreatic cancer, or less commonly be congenital in origin (e.g., biliary atresia). Yellow discoloration of the skin, especially on the palms and the soles, but not of the sclera and mucous membranes (i.e. oral cavity) is due to carotenemiaâ??a harmless condition[ important to differentiate from jaundice.','null','disease image/70.jpg');

The remains were dated by radiocarbon methods to 1-50 A.D. After the end of the 17th century, Norway, Iceland and England were the countries in Western Europe where leprosy was a significant problem. During the 1830s, the number of lepers in Norway, Iceland and England rose rapidly, believed to be caused by frequent visits of sailors who visited Western India, causing an increase in medical research into the condition, and the disease became a political issue. Norway appointed a medical superintendent for leprosy in 1854 and established a national register for lepers in 1856, the first national patient register in the world.\r\nWhen the fear of leprosy was rampant in societies across Europe and Asia there was also an associated rise in crime levels and overall dissatisfaction amongst the population. The leprosariums created during these times had multiple benefits: first, they provided treatment and safe living quarters for all lepers that were admitted; secondly, they eased tension amongst the healthy townspeople; and thirdly, they provided for a more stable populace for the authorities to govern.\r\n','disease image/71.jpg');

Symptoms of the disease first appear, on average, at age 23 years. These first symptoms are typically chronic pain and stiffness in the middle part of the spine or sometimes the entire spine, often with pain referred to one or other buttock or the back of thigh from the sacroiliac joint.\r\nSymptoms appear gradually. Initially they are usually not specific for ankylosing spondylitis. The average onset-to-diagnosis lag time has been estimated to be approximately 8.5 years to 11.4 years. Men are affected more than women by a ratio of about 2:1,[25] with the disease usually taking a more severe course in men than women.\r\nIn 40% of cases, ankylosing spondylitis is associated with an inflammation of the eye (iritis and uveitis), causing redness, eye pain, vision loss, floaters and photophobia. This is thought to be due to the association these two conditions have with inheritance of HLA-B27. Other common symptoms are generalized fatigue and sometimes nausea. Less commonly, aortitis, apical lung fibrosis and ectasia of the sacral nerve root sheaths may occur.\r\nWhen the condition presents before the age of 18, it is relatively likely to cause pain and swelling of large limb joints, particularly the knee. In prepubescent cases, pain and swelling may also manifest in the ankles and feet, where calcaneal spurs may also develop. Pain is often severe at rest, but improves with physical activity. However, many experience inflammation and pain to varying degrees regardless of rest and movement.[citation needed] Ankylosing spondylitis is one of a cluster of conditions known as seronegative spondyloarthropathies, in which rheumatoid factor tests are negative and the characteristic pathological lesion is an inflammation of the enthesis (the insertion of tensile connective tissue into bone).\r\n'),
